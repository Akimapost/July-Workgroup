1. Calculate total Sales by City:
```sql
SELECT Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Owners.OwnerID = Pets.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

2. Calculate total Sales by Pet Kind:
```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
GROUP BY Pets.Kind
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

3. Calculate total Sales by City and Pet Kind:
```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Owners.OwnerID = Pets.OwnerID
GROUP BY Pets.Kind, Owners.City
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

4. Calculate Average sales by City:
```sql
SELECT Owners.City, AVG(Procedures.Price) AS AverageSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Owners.OwnerID = Pets.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY AverageSales DESC;
```

5.  Explore relationships with SQLight.

In SQLite, relationships between tables are typically defined through primary keys and foreign keys. 
These relationships help to organize and link data across different tables in a relational database.

Key Concepts:

### Primary Key (PK):
https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-primary-key/ 

A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row can be uniquely identified.

Example: In a Pets table, PetID could be a primary key.

### Foreign Key (FK):
https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-foreign-key/

A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between 
the two tables.

Example: OwnerID in the Pets table might be a foreign key that references OwnerID in the Owners table.

Types of Relationships:

### One-to-Many:

A single record in one table is related to multiple records in another table.

Example: One owner (Owners.OwnerID) can have many pets (Pets.OwnerID).

### Many-to-Many:

Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table, usually implemented through a 
junction table.

Example: Sales transactions linking multiple pets to multiple procedures.

### One-to-One:

A single record in one table corresponds to a single record in another table.

Example: If each pet had a unique insurance record, you might have a one-to-one relationship 
between Pets and Insurance.
